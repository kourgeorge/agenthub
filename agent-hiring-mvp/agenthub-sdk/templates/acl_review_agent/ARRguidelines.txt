Here is a **concise summary of the most important items from the ARR Reviewer Guidelines (ACL Rolling Review):**

---

## **Key Policies and Guidelines**

### 1. **Recognition & Accountability**

* **Great reviewers/chairs** can now be nominated for recognition and even free virtual registration for ACL events.
* **Irresponsible reviewers/chairs** (e.g., who disappear, submit low-quality or LLM-generated reviews) may face consequences, including being barred from submitting or reviewing in the next cycle.

### 2. **Confidentiality & Anonymity**

* All submission/review information is confidential and should not be shared or uploaded to non-privacy-preserving AI tools.
* Reviewers should avoid attempting to discover author identities; if identity is known, disclose to Area Chair (AC).
* Follow double-blind procedures strictly.

### 3. **Main Tasks for Reviewers**

#### **Task 1:** Allocate sufficient time for reviewing **and** post-review discussion.

#### **Task 2:** Immediately check assignments for expertise and conflicts of interest (COI); flag if mismatched or COI is present.

#### **Task 3:** Write strong, specific, and fair reviews:

* Adjust expectations for paper types.
* Be specific in feedback.
* Avoid common review issues and bias (e.g., penalizing for lack of SOTA, "not novel" without references, criticizing for negative results or "simplicity").
* Check for common problems in NLP papers (e.g., unvalidated LLM evaluation, reproducibility, unmotivated choices, undisclosed data issues).
* Provide justified scores for **soundness**, **excitement**, and **overall assessment**.
* Use professional and neutral tone.

#### **Task 4:** After author response/discussion, **update your review** as appropriate, acknowledging if your concerns were addressed.

### 4. **Desk Rejection Checklist**

* Papers may be desk-rejected for: scope/appropriateness issues, anonymity or style/length violations, missing Limitations section, or severe issues with Responsible NLP checklist responses.

### 5. **Resubmissions**

* **Repeat reviewers:** Focus on whether prior weaknesses were addressed—do not raise new issues unless critical.
* **Substitute/fresh reviewers:** After initial review, consult previous reviews/revision notes to see if concerns have been addressed.

### 6. **Ethics & Generative AI Use**

* **Flag for ethics review** if there are concerns about data collection, potential harm, etc.
* **Generative AI can be used** for paraphrasing or language help, but not for writing review content. Never upload confidential information to public AI tools.
* Authors must disclose use of generative AI in submissions.

### 7. **Professional Conduct**

* Maintain a **professional and respectful tone**. Avoid sarcasm, rudeness, and unconstructive comments—peer review should be supportive and collegial.
